# LibO-Tankstelle

A small tool, which can be used at exhibitions

# How to use

You need on e of the following to install and run this program

-   Microsoft Windows Vista+

-   Any other operating system with installed Mono Runtime (
    <http://www.go-mono.com/mono-downloads/download.html)>

## First run

The first run might be difficult. Please do not get frustrated!

1.  Run the program. A message-box will appear telling you "l10n.txt"
    could not be found. It will be created automatically with DE / EN.
    If you need different language, please edit this file. The first
    language is the default language. IF you change the language, please
    be sure to change the flags (2 pictures found at `/pictures/flags`)

2.  Run the program again. A message-box will appear telling you
    "files.txt" could not be found. A bare file will be created. **You
    have to edit this file manually!** Insert the path to the requested
    file right before the $#$. `DEBHELPDE32` means
    $Linux Debian helppack of primary language 32-bit$. At the moment t
    is recommended, that the secondary language stays "$en_US"$, as only
    the primary language has the possibility to add translation of the
    UI as well as translated help in 2 individual packages (only some
    OS).

3.  Congrats, if you did everything right the program should start now.
    Please make sure you do not use the default logos ;)

## How to get the logo size for my resolution?

It is quite easy. When the program is running idle [so doing nothing],
press $F1$. To close the program, use $ESC$.
